        <p class="post-text">McLaren's Lando Norris scored his first win in Formula 1 at a thrilling Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, beating Max Verstappen and disrupting an otherwise perfect weekend for Verstappen that included a sprint race win and pole position.</p>
        <p class="post-text">A jubilant Norris celebrated victory after more than 100 races and several near-collisions as the crowd erupted in cheers. Before Miami, Norris held the unwanted record of most podiums in F1 without a race win, at 15.
            “Woo!” he shouted on team radio after he took the checkered flag. “I love you all. ... We did it!”
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">After the race, Norris, who started in fifth, leaped into the arms of his crew and was hoisted up. He was greeted by rapturous cheers of “Lando! Lando!” as he took the winner’s trophy to the podium.
            Verstappen started first and held his lead, but a mid-race safety car put Norris ahead of the pack. When the race restarted, Verstappen had no answer for Norris, who sped off into the distance. Verstappen has dominated F1 for the last two seasons, despite the internal drama and turmoil his team has faced in recent months. He finished second Sunday, as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took third.
