        <p class="post-text">Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso believes that 19 of the 20 Formula 1 drivers already know from pre-season testing in Bahrain that they will not win the championship in 2024.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Alonso reckons the new AMR24 marks an improvement over last year’s car, but he is reluctant to say that the team will repeat its flying start from 2023 - due to the winter progress made by rival teams.

            However, the two-time champion believes that reigning constructors’ champion Red Bull will be another step ahead given the ‘surprisingly’ extensive changes undertaken for the RB20, which features Mercedes-style canons on the engine cover and vertical sidepod intakes.
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">As such, Alonso believes that Red Bull lead driver Max Verstappen is already nailed on for the 2024 drivers’ title, with the Spaniard seemingly dismissing the chances of team-mate Sergio Perez. Asked about the early indications from testing, Alonso said: “I don't have a crystal ball to know what the others are doing.

            “I think Max is the world champion and Red Bull is dominating the sport. Also, the concept that they presented this year, it's also a surprise.
            
            “At the moment, we just have to watch them and see how they perform.
            
            “I think 19 drivers in the paddock now will think that [they] will not win the championship.
            
            “It happens 99% of the time in your career. This is a brutal sport.”
