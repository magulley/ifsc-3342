        <p class="post-text">Carlos Sainz is one of 12 F1 drivers without a contract for next season as he will leave Ferrari at the end of this year with Lewis Hamilton joining the team.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Sainz, who took another podium on Sunday at the Japanese Grand Prix, will leave Ferrari at the end of this year as he's replaced by Lewis Hamilton. The 29-year-old has been linked with Mercedes, Aston Martin, Red Bull and Sauber, who will become Audi from 2026. A move to Mercedes would signal a straight swap with Hamilton, joining Aston Martin would likely mean replacing Fernando Alonso and switching to Red Bull would be in place of Sergio Perez, unless Max Verstappen surprisingly leaves.
            Audi's takeover of Sauber means there could be a new line-up, with the current pairing of Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu far from certain.
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">"I'm talking to a few [teams] because that's what my management team and myself should do when I don't have a job for next year yet. So, we're talking to pretty much all of them," said Sainz.
            "It's just a matter of obviously going more into detail and seeing the more realistic options and what are the best options for me and for my future, which I don't have any news for you or nothing to say here.
