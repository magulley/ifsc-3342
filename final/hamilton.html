        <p class="post-text">Lewis Hamilton has given a further insight into his decision to sign with Ferrari for 2025, with the Briton shedding light on what changed following the signing of his contract with Mercedes last summer. The seven-time world champion also expanded on the influence of his relationship with Scuderia boss Fred Vasseur, and how he wants to end his final chapter with the Silver Arrows on a high.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The F1 world was taken by surprise when news of Hamilton’s switch to Ferrari emerged at the beginning of February, particularly in light of the seven-time world champion having previously suggested that he would end his career in the sport with Mercedes. Hamilton had signed a new deal with his current team in the summer of 2023, which would keep him at the squad through to the end of 2025.
            However, activating a release option in his contract allowed Hamilton to put pen to paper with Ferrari, who he will join next season after his final campaign with Mercedes in 2024.
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">During pre-season testing in Bahrain, Hamilton sounded a positive note about his initial experiences with Mercedes’ new car, the W15. Outside of the car, though, the 39-year-old faced no shortage of questions about his impending move to the red team.
            When asked about what had changed between signing for Mercedes last summer and opting to join Ferrari, Hamilton explained: “In the summer we signed, and obviously I, at that time, saw my future with Mercedes. But an opportunity came up in the new year and I decided to take it. “I feel like… it was obviously the hardest decision that I think I’ve ever had to make. Obviously I’ve been with Mercedes for, I think it’s like 26 years they’ve supported me, and we’ve had an absolutely incredible journey together. We’ve created history within the sport, and it’s something I take a lot of pride in and I’m very proud of what we’ve achieved. “But I think ultimately I’m writing my story and I felt like it was time to start a new chapter.”
