        <p class="post-text">Speculation mounts as Logan Sargeant's tenure with Williams might end following the upcoming Miami Grand Prix. Inside sources hint at a potential replacement by Mercedes junior driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli.
            The future of American driver Logan Sargeant at Williams is hanging by a thread as reliable sources, including seasoned F1 journalist Joe Saward, suggest his final Formula 1 outing could be at his home race in Miami next week. Amidst a challenging rookie season last year, Sargeant managed to score only a single championship point, doing so at the Austin Grand Prix. Despite these struggles, Williams had extended his contract into the 2024 season.
            </p>
        <p class="post-text">Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff has indicated that Antonelli is an option to replace Lewis Hamilton in 2025. This raises the stakes for Sargeant, as Antonelli's trajectory seems aligned not only with a seat at Williams but potentially with a more prestigious position at Mercedes. This sequence of movements is pegged to coincide with upcoming regulation changes in 2026, fostering a conducive environment for Antonelli's entrance into the top tier of motorsports. Saward explained in the latest Green Notebook:</p>
        <p class="post-text">"Logan Sargeant would get to race in front of his home crowd in Miami before being let goâ€¦ This might all sound brutal, but F1 is about excellence, Top Gun, the elite, the best of the best, and Sargeant has had plenty of chances. </p>
