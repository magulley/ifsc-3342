        <p class="post-text">The Mercedes boss found himself on the receiving end of scathing remarks from Oliver Mintzlaff, with the energy drinks company's managing director not happy about Mercedes trying to lure Verstappen away from his current squad.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Mintzlaff told Bild Am Sonntag: "I understand the pressure that Toto Wolff and perhaps other teams have after years of being behind. But I think Toto Wolff should concentrate on his challenges. He has enough of those."And it also has something to do with respect. If I keep talking about the personnel of other teams, that's not right."</p>
        <p class="post-text">Wolff is totally unmoved by what was said, though, and suggests that what Mintzlaff was talking about was irrelevant to him."I d9n't know what this guy is commenting on," said Wolff. "It has no relevance for me."There were reports – which Wolff has denied – of Mercedes lining up a meeting with Verstappen and his representatives this week to discuss a potential 2025 deal.</p>
